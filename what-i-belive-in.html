    <h2>What I belive in, and what I follow.</h2>
    <p>Their are many religions out their, but all of them are unique and different in their own ways. I have, since a very young age, belived in Greek/Roman Mythology as a whole. Though as I grew older I started hearing and reading about even more what religion means to other people and how they incorperate it into their daily lives. While I do Follow Greek/Roman Mythology, I have also taken different aspects of other religions and combined them into my own "religion methodology". Some of the religions that i've taken aspects from include:</p>
    <li>Hinduism</li>
    <li>Budism</li>
    <li>Norse Mythology</li>
    <li>Confusionism</li>
    <li>shito</li>
    <p>While Greek/Roman Mythology have pantheons of gods that control many aspecs of our universe I still belive that science has something to do with those fenomina even though the myths state that gods control them.</p>
