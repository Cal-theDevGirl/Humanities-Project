    <h2>What I belive in, and what I follow.</h2>
    <p>Their are many religions out their, but all of them are unique and different in their own ways. I have, since a very young age, belived in Greek/Roman Mythology as a whole. Though as I grew older I started hearing and reading about even more what religion means to other people and how they incorperate it into their daily lives. While I do Follow Greek/Roman Mythology, I have also taken different aspects of other religions and combined them into my own "religion methodology". Some of the religions that i've taken aspects from include:</p>

    <p>While Greek/Roman Mythology have pantheons of gods that control many aspecs of our universe I still belive that science has something to do with those fenomina even though the myths state that gods control them.</p>
    <p>Many of the aspects that i've taken from religions, have mostly been related to something in Greek/Roman/Norse Mythology which I follow and study very heavily.</p>

                What I've Taken Away From Greek and Roman Mythology
            </b>
        </h3>
        <p>I've taken a lot away from roman and greek mythology, I believe in both of their pantheons of gods/goddeses. Though the some of the powers they have I don't belive in. I've also taken aspects form Hinduism, like reincarnation, and good and bad karma.</p>
